# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Francisco, but everyone calls me Cisco, I began my professional journey as an artist, photographer, and critical thinker. Working behind the lens taught me to capture stories, pay attention to detail, and understand how small adjustments can transform an entire composition.

Over time, I realized these same skills — observing patterns, analyzing structure, and thinking critically — are essential in data analysis and programming. Today, I am transitioning into the world of data analytics, where I transform raw data into meaningful insights, just as I once transformed raw images into visual narratives.

For me, moving from photography to data is not a shift away from creativity, but an evolution of it — combining artistic vision with technical precision to create impact in new ways.
